\begin{itemize}
    \item Use variable $z$ that indicates complex value in generating functions.
    \item Give particular names to binomial identities, for example \textit{absorption identity}
    \item Give particular names to generating functions to remember them easily
    \item Use subscript indices for generating functions that are powers of some value $t$, for clarity.
    Example: $A_t(z) = (1+z)^t$ for binomial coefficients.
\end{itemize}
